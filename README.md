## Project Description

⦁	This project is based on a song given by the user. If this song is among the 100 "Top" songs, it returns a recommendation from this list, otherwise, it extracts the characteristics of the song, classifies it in a group of "Clusters", returns a song from the same "Cluster" and with similar characteristics.

As an extra, we have added a context to the music recommender, i.e. the user can choose for which situation he/she is going to listen to that song. Recommending a song that fits the context and the characteristics of the song entered by the user.

## Workflow

(Image Workflow Implemented in slides)

⦁	User introduce one song.

⦁	If it is in the "top 100" it returns a song from this same group of songs.

⦁	If it is not in the "top 100", search the song on spotify, pull out the characteristics of the song.
